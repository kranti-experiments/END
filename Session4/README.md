# Session 4 Assignment
```bash
Change this code in such a way that:
    https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/2%20-%20Upgraded%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb
    it has 3 LSTM layers
    it has used a for loop to do so in the forward function
    the dropout value used is 0.2
    trained on the text that is reversed (for example "my name is Rohan" becomes "Rohan is name my"
    achieves 87% or more accuracy
    once done, share the Github link as well (after training on Google Colab, move the file to GitHub).
